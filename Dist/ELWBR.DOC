 WHAT IS BRIDGE?

 Bridge is a multi-player text-based bridge game.  The game plays
 bridge for up to four players at a table, with the ability for
 people to sit down as a trainee to learn the game from another
 player as he/she plays.
 
 GAMEPLAY
 
 The game plays like bridge would if you were playing in person.
 The seats at the table are labeled North, South, East, and West.
 Trainees may sit alongside a player.  
 
 COMMANDS
 
 The game starts and resets upon command when all seats are empty.
 
 The following are game commands:
 
 Anytime within the game:
 /table, /bids, /myhand, /faceup (dummy), $ (for score sheet), + (priv msg)
 
 Dealer commands:
 /shuffle, /deal
 
 Bidder commands:
 /1heart, /pass, /2notrump, /double, /redouble
 
 Play commands:
 /<card> - e.g. /h4 = heart 4, /d10 = diamonds 10, /sa = spade ace
 
 INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
 
 Simply unzip the game archive to your BBS server directory,
 add the module to your menu, configure the MSG file to your liking, 
 and start the BBS! It's that easy! 

 GAME HISTORY
 
 Bridge was written and developed by Gene Swope of Amusers, Inc, in 1988-89.
 Elwynor Technologies acquired the module in 2004, and ported it to
 MBBS/WG DOS in October 2004 and to Worldgroup 3.2 in February 2006. It was
 then ported to Major BBS V10 in July 2024.
